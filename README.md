# Problem Statement

A pulsar is a type of stellar remnant formed from the collapsed core of a giant star. They have very strong magnetic fields and eject pulses of electromagnetic radiation out like a lighthouse; we can only detect the jet when it is angled at the Earth.

Pulsars are very import to modern physics and astrophysics: they have been used to study nuclear physics, General Relativity, and have even been instrumental in the proof of gravitational waves.

Because of the vastness of space and how distant they are, pulsars are uncommon and very difficult to identify.

Have an automated process to identify them using machine learning methods can the speed at which these stars are discovered and can help advance our scientific knowledge.

The data was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/predicting-a-pulsar-star) and was was taken from the Hight Time Resolution Universe Survey.
